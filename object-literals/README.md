# Assignment - Object Literals
> What is an object literal? Why are they important?

For this assignment you will be creating some objects that relate to robots.  For this assignment, you'll demonstrate competency of object literals.

### Requirements

1. Create an Optimus Prime object literal that contains the following properties: name, faction, power.
2. Create a greet function that returns  'Hi, I'm Optimus Prime'
3. Create an Megatron object literal that contains the following properties: name, faction, power.
4. Create a greet function that returns  'Hi, I'm Megatron'
5. Create a FACTION constant that looks like this.

```js
const FACTIONS = {
  Autobots: 'autobots',
  Decepticons: 'decepticons'
};
```
6. Export out the FACTIONS object literal.  Constants give an opportunity to define known values like 'autobots' and 'decepticons'


### Observations

* Object literals are a great way to setup known objects
* What code was duplicated? Why is that good/bad?
* What optimizations could you do to the greet function?
* Why was creating the FACTION constant a good thing?
